## Strategy  
Simplicity. My aim was to give easy access to information and give relaxing feel to user.

## Scope
I want to provide user with a simple overview of who I am, what are my skills and portfolio and how to contact me.

## Structure
In the "About me" section, I wanted to give few information about myself with a personal pitch and links how to reach me.
In the "Portfolio" section, I tried to give a brief overview of my skills and work I have done with link to each GitHub live demo.

## Surface
The beach theme with turquoise sea was used to relax the user and ilicit a positive response.
