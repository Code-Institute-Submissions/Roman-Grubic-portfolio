# Roman Grubic - Portfolio
### Milestone project - User Centric Front End Development Project 

This is my portfolio with two projects that I built so far in the course using technologies which I learned to this point. It also has a section about myself, my skills and my contact information.

# Demo
Portfolio demo can be found [here](https://romangrubic.github.io/first-milestone-project/).

# UX
## Strategy  
Simplicity. My aim was to give easy access to information and user-friendly design.

## Scope
I want to provide user with a simple overview of who I am, what are my skills and portfolio and how to contact me.

## Structure
In the "About me" section, I wanted to give few information about myself with a personal pitch and links how to reach me.
In the "Portfolio" section, I tried to give a brief overview of my skills and work I have done with link to each GitHub live demo.

## Surface
The beach theme with turquoise sea was used to relax the user and elicit a positive emotional response.

# Features 
In this section, I will go over different features available in my Portfolio and what I would like to implement at a further stage.
### Existing Features
+ Page is using simple but effective CSS3 style {scroll behaviour: smooth;} for nice and smooth scroling from navigation bar to sections.
+ Also using a border around the letters which I found on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2570972/css-font-border).
### Features Left to Implement
+ I would like to make the page "alive" with JavaScript in the future.

# Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap (4.4)
# Testing
This site was was tested on multiple browsers (Google Chrome, Mozzila Firefox and Opera) and on multiple mobile devices (Samsung J6+, Huawei P Smart) and it shown responsivness and compatibility.

All links will open in new tab using 'target:"_blank"'and have been manually tested to ensure they are redirecting to correct destination.

The contact form has been secured with 'required' attribute for 'name', 'email' and 'project description' field, otherwise it will show the user to fill out the field and will not submit.
Also the 'email' field has to be filled with a valid email address or else will show an error for invalid email format.
# Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages and will automatically update upon new commits to master branch.

In order to set this repository on GitHub pages, I had to change the settings and under "GitHub pages", 
which is designed to host personal, organization, or project pages from a GitHub repository, publish it.
