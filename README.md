# Roman Grubic - Portfolio
### Milestone project - User Centric Front End Development Project 

This is my portfolio with two projects that I built so far in the course using technologies which I learned to this point. It also has a section about myself, my skills and my contact information.

# Demo
A live portfolio demo can be found [here](https://romangrubic.github.io/first-milestone-project/).

# UX
## Strategy  
Simplicity. My aim was to give easy access to information and user-friendly design.

## Scope
I want to provide user with a simple overview of who I am, what are my skills and portfolio and how to contact me.

## Structure
In the "About me" section, I wanted to give few information about myself with a personal pitch and links how to reach me.
In the "Portfolio" section, I tried to give a brief overview of my skills and work I have done with link to each GitHub live demo.

## Surface
The beach theme with turquoise sea was used to relax the user and elicit a positive emotional response.

# Features 
In this section, I will go over different features available in my Portfolio and what I would like to implement at a further stage.
### Existing Features
+ Page is using simple but effective CSS3 style {scroll behaviour: smooth;} for nice and smooth scroling from navigation bar to sections.
+ Also using a border around the letters which I found on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2570972/css-font-border).
### Features Left to Implement
+ I would like to make the page "alive" with JavaScript in the future.

# Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap (4.4)
# Testing
This site was was tested on multiple browsers (Google Chrome, Mozzila Firefox and Opera) and on multiple mobile devices (Samsung Galaxy, Huawei, Sony) and it shown responsivness and compatibility.

All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"' and the CV will open in a new tab where user can preview it and download to his/hers default folder. All links have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination.

If you try to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address. Furthermore, the 'required' attribute is added to the 'name,' 'email,' and 'message' fields, so if those fields are not filled in, the form will not submit. If all field are valid, the page will reload. If an employer or recruiter is interested in contacting me, they will have to fill out all fields in order for the form to go through.
# Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/hschafer2017/HSCHAFER-Portfolio.git` into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.
