# Roman Grubic - Portfolio
### Milestone project - User Centric Front End Development Project 

This is my portfolio with two projects that I built so far in the course using technologies which I learned to this point. It also has a section about myself, my skills and my contact information.

# Demo
Portfolio demo can be found [here](https://romangrubic.github.io/first-milestone-project/).

# UX
## Strategy  
Simplicity. My aim was to give easy access to information and user-friendly design.

## Scope
I want to provide user with a simple overview of who I am, what are my skills and portfolio and how to contact me.

## Structure
In the "About me" section, I wanted to give few information about myself with a personal pitch and links how to reach me.
In the "Portfolio" section, I tried to give a brief overview of my skills and work I have done with link to each GitHub live demo.

## Skeleton
add wireframes

## Surface
The beach theme with turquoise sea was used to relax the user and ilicit a positive response.

# Features 
In this section, I will go over different features available in my Portfolio and what I would like to implement at a further stage.
### Existing Features
+ Page is using simple but effective CSS3 style {scroll behaviour: smooth;} for nice and smooth scroling from navigation bar to sections.
+ Also using a border around the letters which I found on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2570972/css-font-border).
### Features Left to Implement
+ I would like to make the page "alive" with JavaScript in the future.

# Technologies
